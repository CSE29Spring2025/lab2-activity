# CSE 29 Lab 2: GitHub Classroom Activity

Welcome to GitHub Classroom! In CSE 29, you will use GitHub Classroom to get started on each PA, host your PA code,
and turn in your work. This lab will introduce you to the GitHub Classroom interface, set you up to communicate with GitHub
on behalf of your account, and equip you with essential commands to make use of Git in your programming career.

What you're looking at right now is the `README.md` file. `README` is a special filename,
as GitHub automatically shows the contents of this file at the root of every repository when you open it up.
In your future public-facing repositories, `README.md` is a great place to explain the repository's purpose and contents.
For software packages, it often includes installation instructions, usage examples, contributor acknowledgment, important links, etc.

Please proceed to clone this repository into `ieng6` according to the lab instructions. Have fun!
